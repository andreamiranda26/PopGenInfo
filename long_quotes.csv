The Final Rule discusses the recovery strategy for lower-48-States grizzly bears including the Recovery Plan which provided management goals for six different grizzly bear populations identified by ecosystems. The Recovery Plan identifies unique demographic recovery criteria for each ecosystem population and states that it is the Services goal to delist individual populations as they recover. Thus the Services action in delisting the GYE DPS is consistent with the Recovery Plan. The GYE population is the first of the six populations to recover. We note however that the population in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem may be eligible for delisting in the near future.

The passage of this bill would circumvent the FWS review process that is currently ongoing and being conducted by experts in their field based on the best available science.

The current FWS review will be over in less than 12 months with an announcement expected in February 2024.

End of Story.,Legislature,Legislature,Law_detailed,1) The Grizzly Bear State Management Act delists the grizzly bear in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the list of threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. It directs the secretary of the Interior to re-issue the final rule delisting the grizzly bear that was published on June 30 2017. 2)It protects the re-issuance of that final rule from judicial review. 3) In 2016 the Obama administration recognized the grizzly bears full recovery when it published a proposed rule delisting the grizzly bear.It concluded - [T]he Yellowstone grizzly bear population has rebounded from as few as 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 or more today. Grizzly bears have more than doubled their range since the mid-1970s and now occupy more than 22500 square mile of the ecosystem. Stable population numbers for grizzly bears for more than a decade also indicate that the [Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem] is at or near its carrying capacity for the bears. In 2017 the Trump administration agreed with the Obama administrations findings. It finalized President Obamas proposed rule delisting the grizzly bear.It also credited the states of Wyoming Montana and Idaho with adopting necessary post-delisting plans and regulations that ensure the species remains recovered under state management.Yet again a liberal federal judge overturned the delisting rule. 4)The Grizzly Bear State Management Act will help address this by giving back to states the authority they need - and have earned - to manage the grizzly bear.5)It will recognize the full recovery of the grizzly bear and delist it once and for all.6)It will honor the conservation investment of people throughout Wyoming Montana and Idaho - and improve the Public safety of our communities.,2000,Before

In 1972 population estimates of the GYE grizzly were as low as 136 bears. In 1975 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the grizzly bear as a threatened species in the lower 48 states. In 2019 the Service placed the number of bears at 728 and some estimates put the population closer to 1200 bears. The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team the group of federal state and tribal scientists and biologists responsible for the long-term monitoring and research of the GYE grizzly have determined that the bears are at or near the carrying capacity of the park the letter continues. Grizzlies are moving well beyond areas where the bears can exist causing loss of human life damage to livestock and eroding Public support for the recovery of this iconic and important species.,2021,Recent

The science is clear. Its time for the Department of the Interior to follow it. 2) In the letter Senator Lummis and the other Members of Congress wrote Grizzly bears have nearly tripled the extent of their occupied range in the GYE since the 1980s and reporting a conservative estimate of NCDE has more than doubled its size in range and tripled its population count from as few as 300 bears in 1986 to 1068 bears today.,2021,Recent

Milder winters have allowed bark beetles to decimate the white-bark pine whose nuts are a critical food source for grizzlies. Meanwhile a slight seasonal shift for plants that grizzlies rely on when they prepare to hibernate and when they emerge in the spring is changing the creatures denning habits.The result some biologists say is that bears accustomed to feasting on berries and nuts in remote alpine areas are being pushed into a more meat-dependent diet that puts them on a collision course with the other dominant regional omnivore: humans.,2010,During I

Removing Endangered Species Act safeguards could pave the way for the trophy hunting of grizzly bears in parts of Montana Idaho and Wyoming. 2) The Fish and Wildlife Service will now begin a status review of these grizzly bear populations to determine whether removal of federal protections is warranted. The Service requests that the Public submit comments during the review. A third petition filed by Idaho sought to delist grizzly bears across the lower 48 states. The Fish and Wildlife Service today denied that petition. Grizzlies currently occupy approximately just 6% of their historical range in the lower 48 states.3) Montana passed new anti-predator legislation and regulations that imperil grizzly bears wolves and other wildlife.

We further suggest a sufficient number of collared bears be female in order to advance managers knowledge of transportation corridors impacts on this essential demographic (see Additional Mitigation Measures below). Deploying collars in the HCP corridor should accomplish two beneficial outcomes. First it could help bear managers address Public concerns and limit conflicts in areas of the corridor where conflicts are occurring.

In Greater Yellowstone Coalition the agencys formal plan for delisting the Yellowstone grizzly bear population as a threatened species avoided specifying particular risks that might justify relisting instead offering a vague promise to carefully monitor the grizzly population.359 The court demanded greater explanation of why the decline in whitebark pine which had been linked with grizzly mortality would not threaten the species.360 Understandably the agency had not built a record about an issue that its open-ended management and monitoring framework did not even specifically discuss.,2019,Recent

The plan/DEIS evaluates the impacts of a range of alternatives for restoring the grizzly bear to the United States (U.S.) portion of the NCE a portion of its historical range. Alternative A would continue existing management practices and assume no new management actions would be implemented beyond those available at the outset of the grizzly bear restoration planning process. Under Alternative A grizzly bears would not be translocated into the NCE.The action alternatives include capturing grizzly bears from outside the NCE and releasing them into the NCE for a period of time that is dependent on the particular alternative. The lead agencies would focus on translocating grizzly bears from areas that are ecologically similar to potential release sites. This may include grizzly bears from British Columbia Canada or the Northern Continental Divide ecosystem. All of the action alternatives include the replacement of translocated bears in the NCE which are lost from the population due to mortality or emigration during the period of initial releases.The option to designate the NCE grizzly bear population as an experimental population under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act could be applied to any of the action alternatives. The DEIS will assess the potential impacts associated with designating or not designating an experimental population under each action alternative; therefore the DEIS will serve as our National Environmental Policy Act analysis for the proposed restoration effort and any 10(j) experimental population rule.Alternative B would involve an initial release of up to 10 grizzly bears followed by a period of monitoring in which additional releases would not occur. The alternative would then either repeat the initial release or default to alternative C as described below. At the conclusion of the initial release there would be a period of adaptive management where additional bears could be released based on a number of factors including human-caused sources of mortality genetic limitations population trends and the adjustment of the sex ratio.Alternative C would involve the yearly release of up to 5 grizzly bears for a 5 to 10-year period to achieve an initial population of 25 grizzly bears. At the conclusion of these releases there would be an adaptive management period where additional grizzly bears could be released based on a number of factors including human-caused sources of mortality genetic limitations population trends and the adjustment of the sex ratio.Alternative D would involve the yearly release of the maximum number of grizzly bears available for capture (anticipated to be 5 to 7 bears) until the minimum population estimate in the NCE reaches 200 grizzly bears.,2017,During II

It recognized that scientific uncertainty generally calls for deference to agency expertise but explained that it was insufficient for an agency to merely invoke scientific uncertainty to justify an action such as a delisting decision particularly where there is evidence however uncertain of a threat to the species.101 To the contrary FWS needed to rationally explain why uncertainty about the impact of whitebark pine loss on the grizzly bear would justify a delisting decision rather than further study.102FWS again sought to delist the Yellowstone grizzly bear DPS in 2017 which gave rise to another lawsuit. Again the Ninth Circuit found that FWS had failed to justify the delisting decision-however the appellate decision did not touch on climate-related threats or climate science.103,2022,Recent

Grizzly populations in these areas have increased dramatically for more than two decades.This shows that the combination of habitat protection and hunting restrictions might keep grizzlies from declining further in other parts of their range. We have the motivation and tools to protect grizzly bears but it will take a renewed commitment to conservation by the B.C. government to ensure the long-term survival and health of our wild and cherished neighbours. Lets work together to make sure this happens soon.,2011,After I

But their assurances that bears have met recovery goals are cold comfort. Bears are not meeting recovery goals. Last year female grizzly bears were killed at a rate that is unsustainable even by the governments own standards. And the recovery targets are themselves deficient: In 1995 a federal judge rejected the grizzly recovery plan as inadequate to ensure a recovered bear population. That plan has never been fixed. Meeting a flawed plans arbitrary recovery targets is passing the wrong test.If we really have enough bears why is the government planning to truck in an outside grizzly every 10 years to prevent genetic inbreeding in the park?

Even the most optimistic estimates for total numbers of grizzly bears in the contiguous United States are in the range of 2100 animals distributed among four isolated or partially isolated populations. Even the largest of these populations--the Northern Continental Divide and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystems--number no more than about 1000 bears each./4 Thus the NCDE and GYE grizzly bear populations continue to qualify for federal protections because their populations are not large enough to ensure viability without meaningful connectivity to other populations.

At the time the population of grizzly bears in the lower 48 was estimated to be in the hundreds. Today the population in the NCDE alone is estimated at approximately 1100 bears. In accordance with the NCDE Conservation Strategy and administrative rule FWP is committed to keeping a viable and healthy population. In 2018 the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission approved a population objective for the ecosystem to maintain a population size above 800 bears with at least 90 percent certainty. Effectively this would mean managing for a population of approximately 1000 grizzly bears.,2021,Recent

7,2023-03-23,State Wildlife Agency,Director of Wyoming Game and Fish Brian Nesvik,Testimony of Brian R. Nesvik Director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department before the House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water Wildlife and FIsheries on Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2023,Executive,Executive,State_of_science,The GYE grizzly bear population is fully recovered as measured by all federally developed recovery criteria. Quantifying and measuring recovery has beenchallenging to say the least. This challenge has not resulted from difficulty with thebiology and science but rather the ever-changing goal posts established by the Serviceand conclusions developed in court decisions by federal judges. Despite thesechallenges I can state unequivocally that for two decades this population has beenbiologically recovered and is healthy and viable. From the stated purposes of the ESAa recovered population is one that: has the capability to offset human-caused mortalityis large enough to ensure a high probability of survival considering demographic andenvironmental stochasticity and has reproductive females distributed throughout therecovery area. The robust dataset for this population affords long-term insight into itsbiological health. It has continually demonstrated a steady increase in abundancedensity and distribution (see upcoming figures). Recent updates in the science usedto estimate abundance provide for more accurate information. Based on all availablemetrics the population exceeds 1000 grizzly bears in the DMA — a number that isdouble the original number needed to deem it a recovered population. Annual grizzlybear mortality has remained below established thresholds despite increasing humancaused mortality due to a growing population. Reproductive females occupy the entireDMA and have for decades. These facts are relevant because they directly tie to therecovery criteria established by the Service informed by recommendations fromgrizzly bear experts.,2023,Recent

Nesvik Director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department before the House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water Wildlife and FIsheries on Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2023,Executive,Executive,Human_wildlife_conflict,Their expansion in range into unsuitable habitats has created significant challenges forall states and agencies involved due to the ever-increasing rise in human/bear conflictpotential. Dangerous encounters with humans destruction of private property (mostlylivestock) and bear occupancy in human-dominated landscapes are all the reality ofan expanding population. An expanding population was promoted and was the statedobjective for decades but once grizzly bears surpassed the suitable habitat of the GYEthe expansion continued. Now our people deal directly with grizzly bears expandinginto areas that are primarily rural and agricultural communities not pristinebackcountry wilderness sanctuaries. People working living and recreating in theseareas were assured grizzly bears would not be allowed to permanently occupy these areas outside of suitable habitat by the state and federal entities involved in recovery. This promise inspired support for recovery by local citizens. Occupancy in thesehuman-dominated areas far from biologically suitable habitats is not a realistic scenario for success from a human or bear perspective. When evaluating verified grizzly bear conflicts in Wyoming we have documented awidespread increase in conflicts associated with the increased distribution of grizzlybears. The conflict potential has been exacerbated as bears have expanded beyond thosehabitats suitable for their long-term viability. From 1990-1999 we averaged 79conflicts annually. From 2000-2009 that number jumped to 150 annual verifiedconflicts and from 2010-2022 we averaged approximately 220 verified grizzly bearconflicts in Wyoming (see Fig. 5). Based on the combined efforts of our Bear WiseWyoming program community based education programs increased bear resistantinfrastructure in grizzly bear habitats and countless sacrifices and adaptations by thePublic we have decreased the overall conflict potential within the DMA as much ascan be expected. Conflicts associated with property damage garbage and other typesare <10% of all annually verified incidents. Conversely the same cannot be said forconflicts between grizzly bears and livestock with more than 60% of annual incidentsbetween grizzly bears and people being the result of livestock depredationpredominantly cattle.,2023,Recent

We know there are grizzlies close to the edge of Choteau. 2) A bear was simply accessing open feed Madel said. Thats not a conflict. Its a reality of our urban interface ... its not effective to set a trap capture the bear relocate it and then continue to keep feed out. The bear will either come back or more likely another bear will take its place. 3) The bear seemed slightly food conditioned Madel said. Bears are losing weight this time of year. If there is food available they will come in. This bear appeared to be getting feed there a while.

1574,2013-12-05,Governor,Greg Gianforte (R-MT),How the culture wars came for grizzly bears,Executive,Executive,Law_detailed,1) Mr Gianforte is a central character in this drama. In 2021 he petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to remove the NCDE grizzlies from the endangered-species list arguing that the bears have fully recovered. Wyoming and Idaho sent similar petitions about the GYE bears and the entire population of grizzlies in the lower 48 respectively. The latter petition was denied. But the agency could decide as early as February whether the bears in the other two ecosystems still need federal protections.2) During an interview at his office in Helena Mr Gianforte admits that his campaign to get the bear delisted is not just about population numbers. A huge stuffed grizzly stands by the entrance to the room and seems to stare inquisitively at your correspondent as if it knows its species is the topic of conversation. It’s a tenth-amendment issue says the governor referring to states’ rights. There is nothing in our constitution that talks about wildlife anywhere. And yet the federal government has taken a very strong role.,2013,After I

And for grizzly bears in the Swan Valley one of the best things that could have happened because it was a large amount of land. And it was prime real estate. And if it had been subdivided people would of been building a lotta houses down there. And it just wouldve increased the number of human-bear conflicts in the Swan.,2010,During I

14,2016-05-16,State commitee member,David Mattson Montana bear biologist and opponent of delisting the grizzly,Grizzly Face-Off,Legislature,Legislature,Recovery_goals,Mattson however is not so sure. The traditional counting method the Chao2 estimator which extrapolates population estimates and growth trends from ground and aerial observations of females and their young cubs is prone to overestimation he says. And a newer technique mark-resight which uses a combination of radio-collar tracking and aerial observation is also faulty according to critics in that it can generate population trends that would be biologically impossible. Meanwhile University of Colorado ecologist Daniel Doak found that the aerial search effort had increased substantially over the past 27 years giving the false impression that the Yellowstone population was increasing. This leads folks like Mattson to believe the general population trend has remained stagnant or even declined despite the official counts.,2016,After I
